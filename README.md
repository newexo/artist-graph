# Artist graph

This project is a set of Python tools for creating graphs of artists and collaborators. It is based on NetworkX, which
creates an annotated graph whose nodes are people and works of art. Examples of this include the following:

- Citation graphs of scholars and their academic papers
- Movies and the actors, writers, directors and producers who make them
- Music, and the musicians, composers, and producers who create it
